/**
 * YAML scripts are an extension of this implementation to YAML. Roughly, a
 * YAML script takes a node and transforms this into another node. In a representation, YAML scripts
 * can be defined at any point in which anchors are allowed and are recognized by {@code @}.
 * 
 * In this implementation, requested scripts are required. This implies, that any YAML file with undefined scripts are rejected.
 * In the YAML case {@link Yaml.Mode#Json}, all provided scripts provided and therefore
 * any document containing script information is rejected.
 * 
 * Scripts are especially useful for configuration. For example, the {@link IncludeScript} takes a scalar (or an array of [array of...] scalars) and
 * includes them into the current script as a YAML object. Other scripts (modifying scalars with environment variables for example) are of course
 * possible.
 * <p>From a technical point of view, a script is a factory for a filter for {@link Handler}'s. The script takes input from the document and generates
 * input for the filterd {@link Handler}.
